# Project Brief: AI-Powered Youth Soccer Coaching Platform

**Project Name:** Youth Soccer AI Platform (Codename: "Project Unify")
**Author:** Mary, Business Analyst
**Date:** August 1, 2025
**Status:** Final

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic foundation for an AI-powered SaaS platform designed to be the central operating system for youth soccer clubs. Market research has confirmed a significant and unmet need for a single, integrated solution that unifies club methodology, automates coach planning, drives player development, and streamlines parent communication. The project has received a confident "Go" recommendation based on a large addressable market, a fragmented competitive landscape, and validated, high-value pain points across all key stakeholder groups.

## 2. Problem Statement

The U.S. youth soccer market is served by a collection of powerful but siloed technology tools. This fragmentation creates a systemic inefficiency:

* **Directors of Coaching (DOCs)** possess a club-wide curriculum but lack the tools to effectively deploy, monitor, and measure its implementation.
* **Coaches** (both professional and volunteer) are time-poor and burdened by the manual, disconnected process of planning sessions that align with the club's philosophy.
* **Players** require modern, engaging, and personalized digital tools to supplement their on-field training, but existing apps are disconnected from their team's specific tactical goals.
* **Parents**, the primary economic stakeholders, lack transparency into the development process and are frustrated by disjointed communication.

This "integration gap" leads to inconsistent coaching quality, unrealized player potential, and a diminished value proposition for the club.

## 3. Proposed Solution

We will build an AI-powered, all-in-one platform that acts as the central nervous system for a youth soccer club. The platform's core function is to transform a static club curriculum into a dynamic, automated, and measurable development workflow.

The **AI Planning Engine** will ingest the club's methodology, analyze game footage, and automatically generate customized, age-appropriate session plans for coaches. A key feature will be the engine's ability to find and embed links to high-quality, publicly available videos (from sources like YouTube) that demonstrate the specific drills and activities in each plan. This core engine will be surrounded by a suite of integrated tools, including a **DOC Analytics Dashboard** for strategic oversight, a **Player Engagement App** with **Individual Development Plans (IDPs)**, gamified "homework," and quizzes, and a **Parent Portal** for streamlined communication and education.

## 4. Target Users

The platform is designed to serve four interconnected personas, each with distinct segments and needs.

## 6. MVP Scope

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on delivering the core, defensible workflow that solves the DOC's problem first.

**Core Features (Must-Have for MVP):**

1.  **AI Planning Engine (V1):** Generates weekly session plans for coaches based on a pre-loaded club curriculum and team age/skill level. **Crucially, it will find and embed links to relevant, publicly available videos (e.g., from YouTube) for each activity.**
2.  **Curated Content Library (V1):** A simple interface for the DOC to review, approve, and manage a list of external video resources that the AI engine can use in its session plans.
3.  **DOC Analytics Dashboard (V1):** Provides analytics on coach engagement (logins, plans created) and curriculum adherence.
4.  **Individual Development Plans (IDPs) (V1):** Allows coaches to create and assign simple, template-based IDPs to players. Players can view their goals and mark them as complete.
5.  **Player Engagement Loop (V1):** Allows coaches to assign video-based "homework" and one tactical quiz per week, linked to IDP goals. Players can complete and track their progress.
6.  **Parent Portal (V1):** Provides parents with access to the team schedule and the weekly training topic.
7.  **In-App Feedback Mechanism (V1):** A simple tool to deliver NPS surveys to coaches and parents to measure satisfaction.

**Out of Scope for MVP:**

* Advanced video analysis and manual tagging (will integrate with existing leaders like Hudl/Veo post-MVP).
* Wearable technology integration.
* Full-scale team management features (payments, registrations).
* Advanced gamification (badges, leaderboards).
* **Proprietary video hosting and library.**

## 7. Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features (The next 12-18 months)

* **AI-Powered Video Analysis:** Integrate video uploading for coaches. The AI will analyze game/practice footage to automatically identify strengths and weaknesses, tag key moments, and directly suggest curriculum-aligned training sessions to address them. This closes the loop between performance and planning.
* **Proprietary Video Library & Hosting:** Build the infrastructure for clubs to upload, store, and manage their own private library of video content, featuring their own coaches and players demonstrating club-specific tactics.
* **Advanced Gamification:** Introduce a full suite of gamification features to the Player App, including points, badges, leaderboards, and team challenges to drive deeper and more sustained engagement.
* **Dynamic IDPs:** Evolve Individual Development Plans from static templates into dynamic, data-driven roadmaps. IDPs will automatically update based on completed homework, quiz results, and eventually, data from video analysis and wearables.

### Long-Term Vision (2-5 years)

* **Full Team & Club Management Suite:** Expand the platform to become a true all-in-one solution by incorporating administrative features such as registrations, payments, and advanced scheduling, aiming to replace tools like TeamSnap for subscribed clubs.
* **Proprietary AI Camera System:** Develop and manufacture our own AI-powered camera hardware for automated game and practice recording. This creates a fully integrated "hardware + software" ecosystem, capturing the entire value chain from video capture to development planning.
* **Wearable Technology Integration:** Integrate with leading wearable providers (like Playermaker/CITYPLAY) to pull objective physical and technical data directly into the platform. This data will feed the AI Planning Engine and provide a new layer of insight for IDPs.
* **Predictive Analytics for DOCs:** Evolve the DOC Dashboard from a descriptive tool (what happened) to a predictive one (what is likely to happen). Use historical data to forecast player development trajectories, identify players at risk of burnout or dropout, and suggest programmatic interventions.
* **Inter-Club Network & Benchmarking:** Create a network for affiliated clubs (e.g., the RSL-AZ ecosystem) to share best practices, anonymous development data, and scouting information, allowing them to benchmark their programs against a larger cohort.

## 8. Constraints, Assumptions, & Risks

### Constraints

* **Timeline:** The MVP must be ready for a pilot program launch within an accelerated **1-2 month timeline.**
* **Budget:** Initial development will be constrained by a seed budget of **$5000.** The MVP scope must be achievable within this budget.
* **Initial Focus:** The platform must succeed as a development tool first; broader club management features are a long-term goal.

### Assumptions

* **Content Availability:** We assume the AI can consistently find relevant, high-quality, and rights-cleared public videos for core curriculum topics.
* **User Adoption:** We assume coaches and players will be willing to adopt a new digital platform as part of their regular workflow.
* **Market Acceptance:** We assume a per-player, per-year pricing model is a viable and accepted structure for club-wide enterprise sales.

### Risks

* **Market Risk:** A major competitor (e.g., Hudl, MOJO) could launch a similar integrated feature set, reducing our first-mover advantage.
* **Adoption Risk:** Volunteer coaches, in particular, may resist adopting a new tool, even if mandated by the DOC, leading to inconsistent implementation.
* **Technical Risk:** The complexity of the AI Planning Engine, especially the video curation and analysis components, may be greater than anticipated, potentially delaying the MVP.
* **Content Risk:** The quality and long-term availability of public videos may be inconsistent, which could negatively impact the user experience and require a faster-than-planned shift to a proprietary library.

## 9. Initial Technical Considerations

* **Platform Architecture:** The system will be a web-based platform, designed with a mobile-first philosophy. The primary interfaces for DOCs and coaches will be through a desktop/tablet web browser. The system will be delivered as a Progressive Web App (PWA), which will not require native integration on mobile devices, to ensure broad accessibility for the player and parent portals.
* **Cloud Infrastructure:** The initial infrastructure will be kept simple and cloud-agnostic by using containerization (e.g., Docker). This approach allows for flexibility and easy migration to a major cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) as the platform grows and requires more scalable, managed services, particularly for its AI/ML components.
* **Future Integrations:** While no third-party integrations are in scope for the MVP, the system architecture must be designed with future integrations in mind. Key future integration points will include club registration systems (e.g., SportsEngine, PlayMetrics), video platforms (e.g., Hudl, Veo), and wearable technology APIs.
