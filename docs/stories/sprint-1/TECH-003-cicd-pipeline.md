# TECH-003: Configure CI/CD pipeline

**Type:** Technical Foundation  
**Points:** 5  
**Priority:** P1 (High)  
**Dependencies:** TECH-001  

## Description
Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration and Vercel for continuous deployment. Establish quality gates and automated testing to ensure code quality from the start.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for PR validation
- [ ] Automated tests run on every push
- [ ] Type checking across all workspaces
- [ ] Linting and formatting checks
- [ ] Build verification for all apps
- [ ] Vercel project connected for preview deployments
- [ ] Production deployment pipeline configured
- [ ] Environment variables properly managed
- [ ] Branch protection rules enabled

## Technical Details

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 8
          
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: 'pnpm'
          
      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      
      - name: Type Check
        run: pnpm typecheck
        
      - name: Lint
        run: pnpm lint
        
      - name: Test
        run: pnpm test
        
      - name: Build
        run: pnpm build
        
      - name: E2E Tests
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
        run: pnpm test:e2e
```

### Vercel Configuration
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "pnpm turbo run build --filter=web",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/web/.next",
  "installCommand": "pnpm install",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "regions": ["iad1"],
  "functions": {
    "apps/api/src/**/*.ts": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Management
- Development: `.env.local` files (gitignored)
- Preview: Vercel environment variables
- Production: Vercel environment variables with restricted access

## Implementation Steps
1. Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
2. Configure Vercel project
3. Set up environment variables in Vercel
4. Create branch protection rules
5. Add status badges to README
6. Configure deployment notifications
7. Set up error tracking (Sentry)
8. Document deployment process

## Testing
- Create a test PR - should trigger all checks
- Merge to develop - should deploy to preview
- Merge to main - should deploy to production
- Force a test failure - should block merge
- Check Vercel preview comments work

## Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production deployments
- `develop` - Staging/preview deployments  
- `feature/*` - Feature branches (PR preview)
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes

## Notes
- Set up Vercel spending limits
- Configure custom domain later
- Add performance budgets
- Consider adding visual regression tests
