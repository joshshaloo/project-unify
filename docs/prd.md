# **PRD: AI-Powered Youth Soccer Coaching Platform**

Version: 4.7  
Status: MVP Finalized

## **1\. Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**

* Reduce coach planning time by 75% while improving curriculum alignment.  
* Enhance holistic player development (tactical, technical, physical, mental).  
* Increase parent satisfaction and confidence in the club's program.  
* Provide DOCs with a data-driven view of club-wide development.  
* Become the leading integrated development platform in the U.S. youth soccer market.

### **Background Context**

The U.S. youth soccer market is currently served by a fragmented landscape of single-purpose technology tools. This creates a significant "integration gap," leading to inconsistent coaching, disconnected player development, and poor communication. This platform aims to solve this systemic inefficiency by providing a single, AI-powered operating system that unifies the club's methodology, automates planning for time-poor coaches, and creates an engaging, measurable development experience for players and their families.
