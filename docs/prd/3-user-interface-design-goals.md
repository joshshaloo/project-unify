# **3\. User Interface Design Goals**

## **Overall UX Vision**

The platform should embody modern, mobile-first design principles while remaining accessible and intuitive for users of all technical abilities. The interface should feel professional yet approachable, using soccer-themed visual elements that enhance rather than distract from functionality.

## **Design Principles**

1. **Progressive Complexity**: Simple tasks should be immediately obvious, with advanced features discoverable as users gain comfort
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information architecture that guides users naturally through workflows
3. **Consistent Patterns**: Reusable components and interactions that build user familiarity
4. **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across devices, optimized for the primary device of each user type
5. **Accessibility First**: WCAG AA compliance as a minimum standard

## **Key Interaction Paradigms**

* **Card-Based Layouts**: For browsing plans, drills, and player profiles
* **Timeline Views**: For season planning and progress tracking
* **Conversational UI**: For AI assistant interactions
* **Dashboard Widgets**: For analytics and quick status updates
* **Swipe Gestures**: For mobile approval workflows and quick actions

## **Core Screens**

* **DOC Dashboard**: Analytics-heavy with drill-down capabilities
* **Coach Planning Interface**: Calendar-centric with AI suggestions panel
* **Player Home**: Gamified progress tracking with current assignments
* **Parent Portal**: Schedule-focused with child's progress highlights

## **Accessibility**

The platform will meet WCAG AA standards with particular attention to:
* Color contrast for outdoor viewing conditions
* Touch targets sized for use during training sessions
* Screen reader compatibility for all core functions
* Keyboard navigation for desktop users

## **Branding**

While maintaining club-specific branding capabilities, the platform itself should have a modern, professional appearance that appeals to both tech-savvy users and traditional coaches.

* **Mobile**: iOS and Android optimization through PWA
* **Desktop**: Full-featured web experience for planning and analytics
* **Future Consideration**: Native mobile apps for offline capability
