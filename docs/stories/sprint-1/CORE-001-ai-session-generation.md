- [ ] Generated plans are editable

## Technical Details

### AI Service Architecture
```typescript
// apps/api/src/services/ai-planning.service.ts
export class AIPlanningService {
  constructor(
    private openai: OpenAI,
    private db: PrismaClient,
    private drillService: DrillService
  ) {}

  async generateSessionPlan(input: GenerateSessionInput): Promise<SessionPlan> {
    // Load context
    const context = await this.loadContext(input);
    
    // Build prompt
    const prompt = this.buildPrompt(context);
    
    // Generate with GPT-4
    const completion = await this.openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: SYSTEM_PROMPT },
        { role: "user", content: prompt }
      ],
      response_format: { type: "json_object" },
      temperature: 0.7,
      max_tokens: 2000
    });
    
    // Parse and validate response
    const plan = this.parseAIResponse(completion);
    
    // Enhance with drill details
    const enhanced = await this.enhancePlan(plan);
    
    return enhanced;
  }
  
  private async loadContext(input: GenerateSessionInput) {
    const [team, curriculum, recentSessions] = await Promise.all([
      this.db.team.findUnique({
        where: { id: input.teamId },
        include: { players: true }
      }),
      this.loadCurriculum(input.teamId),
      this.getRecentSessions(input.teamId, 5)
    ]);
    
    return {
      team,
      curriculum,
      recentSessions,
      coachInput: input.context,
      constraints: input.constraints
    };
  }
}
```

### Prompt Engineering
```typescript
const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an expert youth soccer coach and session planner. 
Generate training sessions that:
- Follow the provided curriculum guidelines
- Are age-appropriate and engaging
- Progress logically through warm-up, main activities, and cool-down
- Include clear coaching points for each drill
- Adapt to team size and skill level
- Incorporate recent performance feedback when provided

Return a structured JSON response with:
{
  "theme": "Session theme/focus",
  "objectives": ["objective1", "objective2"],
  "warmUp": {
    "duration": 15,
    "activities": [...]
  },
  "mainActivities": {
    "duration": 60,
    "activities": [...]
  },
  "coolDown": {
    "duration": 10,
    "activities": [...]
  }
}`;
```

### API Endpoint
```typescript
// apps/api/src/routers/session.ts
export const sessionRouter = router({
  generateWithAI: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      teamId: z.string(),
      date: z.string(),
      duration: z.number().min(30).max(120),
      context: z.object({
        recentPerformance: z.string().optional(),
        focusAreas: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
        constraints: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
      }).optional()
    }))
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      // Check permissions
      await checkTeamAccess(ctx.user.id, input.teamId);
      
      // Queue generation job
      const job = await ctx.queue.send('generate-session', {
        ...input,
        userId: ctx.user.id
      });
      
      return { 
        jobId: job.id,
        status: 'processing' 
      };
    }),
});
```

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up OpenAI client
2. Design prompt templates
3. Implement context loading
4. Create generation service
5. Add queueing for async processing
6. Build response parser/validator
7. Implement drill enhancement
8. Add fallback templates
9. Create generation UI
10. Test with various inputs

## Error Handling
- OpenAI API failures → fallback to templates
- Invalid AI response → retry with refined prompt
- Timeout (>30s) → return partial result
- Rate limiting → queue management
- Context loading fails → use defaults

## Testing
- Generate plans for different age groups
- Verify curriculum alignment
- Test with various coach inputs
- Measure generation times
- Validate drill appropriateness
- Test error scenarios

## Performance Optimization
- Cache curriculum data
- Pre-load common drills
- Stream AI responses
- Background processing
- Result caching for similar inputs

## Notes
- Monitor OpenAI API costs
- A/B test different prompts
- Collect coach feedback on quality
- Plan for fine-tuning option
- Consider fallback to GPT-3.5 for cost

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The AI session generation implementation demonstrates solid architectural decisions and clean separation of concerns. The integration between n8n workflows and the Next.js application is well-structured with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms. The code follows project patterns and maintains type safety throughout.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/lib/ai/n8n-client.ts`
  - **Change**: Added proper environment variable validation in constructor
  - **Why**: Prevents runtime errors with undefined webhook URLs
  - **How**: Constructor now throws an error if N8N_WEBHOOK_URL is not set, ensuring fail-fast behavior

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/lib/trpc/routers/ai.ts`
  - **Change**: Improved n8n response parsing with better activity mapping
  - **Why**: Original code had potential null reference issues and poor data transformation
  - **How**: Added helper functions for phase mapping and space extraction, with safer destructuring of n8n response activities

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/lib/trpc/routers/ai.ts`
  - **Change**: Added utility functions for consistent data transformation
  - **Why**: Eliminates code duplication and improves maintainability
  - **How**: Created `mapPhaseToCategory()` and `extractSpaceFromSetup()` functions for reusable transformations

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/components/sessions/session-generator-form.tsx`
  - **Change**: Enhanced form validation with future date checking
  - **Why**: Prevents users from creating sessions in the past
  - **How**: Added validation to ensure session datetime is in the future before submission

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows project TypeScript patterns, proper error handling, and clean separation of concerns
- Project Structure: ✓ Files are properly organized within the established monorepo structure
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit tests pass, TypeScript compilation successful, no regression detected
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria have been implemented as documented in the Dev Agent Record

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Enhanced environment variable validation in N8NClient constructor
- [x] Improved n8n response parsing with better error handling
- [x] Added helper functions for data transformation consistency
- [x] Enhanced form validation in session generator component
- [x] Verified TypeScript compilation and test suite execution
- [ ] Consider adding unit tests for the new n8n client and AI router functionality
- [ ] Consider implementing retry logic for failed n8n requests
- [ ] Add integration tests for the complete session generation flow

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The implementation properly:
- Validates all user inputs through tRPC schemas
- Uses server-side authentication checks via protectedProcedure
- Sanitizes and validates API responses from external n8n service
- Maintains proper tenant isolation through club-based access controls

### Performance Considerations

The implementation includes proper performance optimizations:
- Implements timeout controls for external API calls (30 seconds)
- Uses efficient database queries with proper includes
- Provides fallback mechanisms to prevent complete failures
- Caches environment variables in constructor for repeated use

### Final Status

✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria and demonstrates production-ready code quality. The n8n workflow integration is robust, the fallback mechanisms are comprehensive, and the UI provides a good user experience. Minor improvements suggested above are enhancements rather than blocking issues.
