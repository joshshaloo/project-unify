## Quote Examples

**Professional Coach:**
> "I need to quickly adapt our session based on who shows up and what happened in our last game. The AI gives me a great starting point, but I always customize based on my observations."

**Volunteer Coach:**
> "I just want to show up and have fun with the kids. If the app tells me exactly what to do and shows me videos of each drill, I feel confident I'm doing it right."
