# Migration Path to Scale

When the MVP proves successful and needs to scale:

## Phase 1: Optimize Current Infrastructure
1. **Add more Swarm nodes** to distribute load
2. **Implement PostgreSQL read replicas** for query scaling
3. **Add Redis Sentinel** for cache high availability
4. **Upgrade home internet** bandwidth if needed

## Phase 2: Hybrid Cloud Migration
1. **Move PostgreSQL to managed service** (RDS, Cloud SQL, or Supabase)
2. **Add CDN** (Cloudflare) for static assets
3. **Keep compute in home lab** to control costs
4. **Add cloud backup** for disaster recovery

## Phase 3: Full Cloud Migration
1. **Migrate to Kubernetes** (EKS, GKE, or AKS)
2. **Use managed services** for all infrastructure
3. **Implement auto-scaling** based on load
4. **Add multi-region support** for global users

The containerized architecture ensures smooth migration at each phase.
